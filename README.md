# AI File Processor (Text Summarization)

This project is a simple application that allows users to upload `.txt` files and get AI-powered summaries of their content. It uses a Java (Spring Boot) backend and an Angular frontend.

## Features

*   Upload `.txt` files.
*   Summarize text content using OpenAI's GPT model.
*   Simple web interface for interaction.

## Project Structure

*   `ai-file-processor/` (Backend - Spring Boot)
    *   `src/main/java/`: Java source code.
    *   `pom.xml`: Maven project configuration.
*   `ai-file-processor-frontend/` (Frontend - Angular) - *Conceptually, files are in `src/`*
    *   `src/app/`: Angular application code.
    *   `angular.json`: Angular project configuration.

## Prerequisites

*   **Java JDK 11** or higher
*   **Maven 3.6** or higher
*   **Node.js and npm** (for Angular frontend - latest LTS version recommended)
*   **Angular CLI** (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
*   **OpenAI API Key**: You need an API key from OpenAI.

## Backend Setup (Java - Spring Boot)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    # cd path/to/ai-file-processor
    # (Assuming pom.xml is in the root for this example)
    ```

2.  **Set OpenAI API Key:**
    The application expects the OpenAI API key to be available as an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    ```
    On Windows, use `set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here` or set it through system environment variables.

3.  **Build the project (optional, as Spring Boot Maven plugin can run it directly):**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend will start, typically on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Frontend Setup (Angular)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    # cd path/to/ai-file-processor-frontend
    # (Conceptually, the Angular files are in `src/` relative to project root)
    # For this flat structure, commands would be run from where `angular.json` would be.
    # Assuming `src/app`, `src/main.ts` etc. are at the root for this setup:
    ```
    *If you were to create a standard Angular project named `ai-file-processor-frontend`, you would `cd ai-file-processor-frontend` first.*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(This command should be run in the directory containing `package.json`, which I haven't explicitly created but is standard for Angular projects. For the current flat file structure, this step is conceptual.)*

3.  **Run the Angular development server:**
    ```bash
    ng serve --open
    ```
    The frontend will typically start on `http://localhost:4200` and open in your default browser.

## How to Use

1.  Ensure both backend and frontend applications are running.
2.  Open the frontend URL (`http://localhost:4200`) in your browser.
3.  Click "Choose a .txt file", select a `.txt` file from your system.
4.  Click the "Summarize" button.
5.  The summary will appear below the button.

## Code Comments and Refinements

*   Added Javadoc-style comments to public methods in services and controllers in the backend.
*   Added comments in Angular components for key logic.
*   Reviewed code for clarity and potential minor improvements.

### Example: Adding Comments to `OpenAiService.java`

```java
// In OpenAiService.java

/**
 * Service to interact with the OpenAI API for text summarization.
 */
@Service
public class OpenAiService {

    // ... existing code ...

    /**
     * Summarizes the given text using the OpenAI API.
     *
     * @param textToSummarize The text to be summarized.
     * @return The summary generated by OpenAI, or an error/placeholder message.
     */
    public String summarizeText(String textToSummarize) {
        // ... existing code ...
    }
}
```

### Example: Adding Comments to `SummarizeController.java`
```java
// In SummarizeController.java

/**
 * REST Controller for handling file summarization requests.
 */
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class SummarizeController {

    // ... existing code ...

    /**
     * Endpoint to upload a .txt file and return its summary.
     *
     * @param file The MultipartFile (.txt) to be summarized.
     * @return A ResponseEntity containing the summary as a string, or an error message.
     */
    @PostMapping("/summarize")
    public ResponseEntity<String> summarizeTxtFile(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {
        // ... existing code ...
    }
}
```

### Example: Adding Comments to `SummarizerComponent.ts`
```typescript
// In summarizer.component.ts

// ... imports ...

@Component({
  // ...
})
export class SummarizerComponent {
  // ... existing properties ...

  /**
   * Handles the file selection event from the input element.
   * Validates if the selected file is a .txt file.
   * @param event The file input change event.
   */
  onFileSelected(event: Event): void {
    // ... existing code ...
  }

  /**
   * Uploads the selected file to the backend and triggers summarization.
   * Handles the response to display the summary or an error message.
   */
  uploadAndSummarize(): void {
    // ... existing code ...
  }

  /**
   * Clears the selected file and resets the file input element.
   */
  private clearFileInput(): void {
    // ... existing code ...
  }
}
```

This README provides a good overview. I'll now add comments to the actual code files as indicated.
*(Self-correction: I will add the comments to the actual code files using `replace_with_git_merge_diff` or `overwrite_file_with_block` as appropriate, not just showing them in the README.)*
